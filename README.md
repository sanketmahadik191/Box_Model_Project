## Introduction

This HTML document defines the structure of a web page that displays a digital representation of a Rothko-style painting. 
The canvas is divided into three colored rectangles, and CSS styles are applied to create a visual effect.

## Project Description:

This project is a web-based digital representation inspired by the iconic artworks of Mark Rothko, an influential abstract expressionist artist.
Rothko's paintings are known for their simplicity, color fields, and emotional depth. In this digital representation, we aim to capture the essence of Rothko's style through HTML and CSS.

## Features:

-Canvas Structure: The project uses HTML's <div> elements to create a canvas-like structure, mimicking the format of Rothko's famous paintings.

-Colorful Rectangles: Three colored rectangles, resembling the blocks of color in Rothko's art, are placed within the canvas. Each rectangle has its unique color and styling.

-Visual Effects: CSS styles are applied to the rectangles to give them a painterly appearance. This includes blur effects, box shadows, border radius, and slight rotations to simulate the texture and depth seen in Rothko's works.

-Responsive Design: The project's layout is responsive, ensuring it looks good on various screen sizes, making it accessible to a wide audience.

## HTML Structure

The HTML code includes the following key elements:

- `<html>`: Defines the root element of the HTML document.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata and links to external resources.
- `<meta>`: Specifies the character encoding.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the web page.
- `<link>`: Links an external CSS file to style the page.
- `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the web page.
- `<div>`: Container elements for structuring the canvas and rectangles.

## CSS Styling

The CSS code in the external "style.css" file is used to style the HTML elements. Here are some key CSS rules:

- `.canvas`: Styles the canvas for the painting, setting its width, height, background color, and applying a blur effect.
- `.frame`: Styles the frame around the canvas, setting its border, width, padding, and margin.
- `.one`, `.two`, `.three`: Styles the colored rectangles, defining their width, height, background color, margin, box shadow, border radius, and rotation.
- `.one`, `.two`: Apply a slight blur effect to rectangles one and two.
- `.three`: Styles the third rectangle with a different color and blur effect.
